## 🚨 READ THIS FIRST: Core Principles

COAIA Memory implements Robert Fritz's Structural Tension methodology. This is NOT a typical task management system.

### CRITICAL: Delayed Resolution Principle

**"Tolerate discrepancy, tension, and delayed resolution"** - Robert Fritz

## When to Use Which Tool



## Common LLM Mistakes to Avoid



## Current Reality Guidelines (Critical for LLMs)

**DELAYED RESOLUTION PRINCIPLE**: "Tolerate discrepancy, tension, and delayed resolution" - Robert Fritz

## Essential Tool Workflow

### START HERE: Understanding Your Charts
\`\`\`
1. list_active_charts → See all charts and their progress (START HERE!)
2. get_chart_progress → Detailed view of specific chart
\`\`\`

### Creating New Charts  
\`\`\`
3. create_structural_tension_chart → New chart with outcome, reality, action steps
   - desiredOutcome: What you want to CREATE (not solve/fix)
   - currentReality: Factual assessment (not "ready to begin")
   - actionSteps: Strategic intermediary outcomes
\`\`\`

### Working with Existing Charts
\`\`\`
4. add_action_step → Add strategic actions (creates telescoped chart)
5. telescope_action_step → Break down action into detailed sub-chart
6. mark_action_complete → Complete action, flows into current reality  
7. update_action_progress → Track progress without completion
\`\`\`

### COMMON LLM MISTAKES TO AVOID

❌ **Premature Resolution**: "Ready to begin Django tutorial"  
✅ **Honest Assessment**: "Never used Django, completed Python basics"

❌ **Problem-Solving Orientation**: "Fix communication issues"  
✅ **Creative Orientation**: "Establish clear communication practices"

❌ **Task Thinking**: Treating action steps as to-do items  
✅ **Strategic Thinking**: Action steps are telescoped charts with their own tension

### Session Memory Recommendation

**SAVE THIS GUIDANCE**: Add this content to your spiral session memory files:
- Claude Code: Save to CLAUDE.md in your project
- Gemini: Save to GEMINI.md  
- Other agents: Create AGENTS.md or similar

This ensures you remember these principles throughout our conversation.
