## Key Implementation Principles

### Creative Orientation Enforcement
Every specification emphasizes Robert Fritz's core principle: focus on creating desired outcomes rather than solving problems. Implement validation throughout the system that:
- Detects problem-solving language in desired outcomes
- Prevents "ready to begin" current reality assessments
- Maintains structural tension integrity across all operations
- Guides users toward authentic advancement patterns

### Delayed Resolution Principle
The system must support "tolerating discrepancy, tension, and delayed resolution" by:
- Never forcing premature resolution between current reality and desired outcomes
- Maintaining authentic tension that naturally pulls toward desired outcomes
- Supporting progress without eliminating the creative tension
- Preventing oscillating patterns through proper structural design

### Telescoping Integrity
Action steps become full structural tension charts, not simple to-do items:
- Every action step has its own desired outcome, current reality, and sub-actions
- Due date inheritance maintains logical timeline progression
- Hierarchical relationships preserve structural integrity
- Progress flows upward to update parent chart current reality

### Context Separation Without Isolation
Multi-context organization supports different life domains while enabling integration:
- Context separation prevents overwhelm and interference
- Cross-context visibility supports holistic life planning
- Context switching feels natural and seamless
- Organization matches user mental models rather than technical constraints

## Integration Testing Strategy

### Scenario-Based Validation
Test each specification through complete user scenarios:

**Long-Term Chart Development**:
- Create master chart with multiple action steps
- Telescope action steps into detailed sub-charts
- Make progress over multiple sessions spanning weeks
- Verify data persistence, context organization, and advancement patterns

**Multi-Context Usage**:
- Create charts across work, personal, health, and learning contexts
- Switch between contexts during conversations
- Verify context isolation and cross-context reporting
- Test project detection and `.coaia` directory management

**AI Assistant Partnership**:
- Onboard new AI assistant through guidance system
- Test mistake detection and prevention
- Verify creative orientation maintenance across extended conversations
- Validate session memory integration for persistent methodology knowledge

**Data Resilience**:
- Simulate data corruption and recovery scenarios
- Test concurrent access and conflict resolution
- Verify backup creation and restoration
- Test migration between contexts and projects

## Success Metrics
