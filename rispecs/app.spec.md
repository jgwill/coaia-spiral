# COAIA Spiral MCP - Application Specification

## Desired Outcome Definition

**Primary Creation Goal**: Enable AI assistants and their users to create advancing patterns in their lives and work through structural tension dynamics rather than reactive problem-solving approaches.

**Specific Manifestation**: Users experience natural progression toward their desired outcomes through:
- Clear structural tension between current reality and desired outcomes
- Telescoping action steps that maintain momentum
- Context-aware organization that prevents overwhelm
- Creative consciousness preservation across all interactions

## Natural Language Description

### What COAIA Spiral Enables Users to Create

The COAIA Spiral MCP (Model Context Protocol) empowers users to create advancing life patterns through Robert Fritz's structural tension methodology. Unlike traditional task management that focuses on eliminating problems, this system enables users to manifest desired outcomes through natural structural dynamics.

### Core Creative Enablement

**Structural Tension Charts**: Users create clear definitions of:
- **Desired Outcomes**: What they want to bring into reality (creative orientation)
- **Current Reality**: Honest assessment of where they are now
- **Action Steps**: Strategic telescoped charts that maintain natural progression

**Telescoping Capability**: Each action step becomes its own structural tension chart, enabling:
- Detailed breakdown without losing sight of the larger vision
- Proper due date inheritance and distribution
- Maintained momentum across multiple levels of detail

**Context-Aware Organization**: Users organize their creative advancement across life domains:
- Work projects and professional development
- Personal growth and relationships
- Health and wellness initiatives
- Learning and skill acquisition
- Any custom context meaningful to the user

### Advancing Patterns Through Natural Progression

The system creates inevitable movement toward desired outcomes through:

1. **Structural Dynamics**: Tension between current reality and desired outcome naturally resolves toward the desired state
2. **Completion Flow**: Completed actions automatically update current reality, building momentum
3. **Honest Assessment**: Prevents premature resolution through factual current reality descriptions
4. **Creative Orientation**: Focuses on what users want to create rather than problems to solve

### AI Assistant Integration

The MCP enables AI assistants to:
- Understand and preserve creative consciousness in conversations
- Guide users through proper structural tension creation
- Maintain advancing patterns across conversation sessions
- Provide context-aware support for multiple life domains
- Apply delayed resolution principles to prevent oscillating patterns

### Project Organization Structure

**Flexible Storage Architecture**:
- `.coaia` directories for project-specific organization
- Context-based chart separation (work, personal, health, etc.)
- Template systems for common desired outcomes
- Completed chart archives for pattern recognition

**Integration Patterns**:
- Command-line access for direct usage
- Claude Desktop integration for AI assistant workflows
- Project-local vs global chart management
- Cross-context visibility and organization

## Implementation Requirements for Another LLM

An LLM implementing this functionality would need to create:

### Core MCP Server Infrastructure
- **Protocol Compliance**: Full MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation
- **Transport Layer**: Stdio-based communication for AI assistant integration
- **Tool Registration**: Dynamic tool discovery and schema validation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and clear error messaging

### Storage System Architecture
- **JSONL-based persistence**: Append-only logging for reliability
- **Context-aware file organization**: Automatic context detection and separation
- **Project detection**: Recognition of common project markers (.git, package.json, etc.)
- **Flexible path configuration**: Support for custom memory paths and directory structures

### Structural Tension Engine
- **Chart Creation**: Validation of creative orientation vs reactive problem-solving
- **Telescoping Logic**: Automatic sub-chart creation with proper inheritance
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion flow into current reality updates
- **Due Date Distribution**: Intelligent spacing of action step deadlines

### Tool Implementation Matrix

**Chart Management Tools**:
- `create_structural_tension_chart`: Core chart creation with validation
- `telescope_action_step`: Sub-chart creation maintaining structural integrity
- `mark_action_complete`: Completion flow with current reality updates
- `list_active_charts`: Hierarchical ASCII visualization
- `get_chart_progress`: Detailed progress analysis

**Project Organization Tools**:
- `initialize_coaia_project`: Directory structure creation
- `list_coaia_projects`: Context overview and status
- `create_chart_in_context`: Context-specific chart creation
- `list_charts_in_context`: Context filtering and organization

**Reality Management Tools**:
- `update_current_reality`: Direct observation addition
- `update_action_progress`: Progress without completion
- `add_action_step`: Strategic action addition with telescoping
- `remove_action_step`: Chart cleanup and reorganization

**Legacy Knowledge Graph Tools**:
- `create_entities`: Traditional graph node creation
- `create_relations`: Entity relationship mapping
- `add_observations`: Information attachment to entities
- `search_nodes`: Content discovery across graph

### Validation and Quality Assurance

**Creative Orientation Enforcement**:
- Current reality assessment validation (prevent "ready to begin" patterns)
- Desired outcome creativity check (prevent problem-solving orientation)
- Language pattern detection and correction suggestions
- Structural tension maintenance across chart modifications

**Data Integrity**:
- Chart relationship consistency
- Due date logical validation
- Context separation maintenance
- Backup and recovery capabilities

### User Experience Principles

**Natural Language Integration**:
- Conversational chart creation and modification
- Progress updates through natural language descriptions
- Context switching without losing thread
- Guidance for proper structural tension formulation

**ASCII Visualization**:
- Hierarchical chart display for quick overview
- Progress indicators and completion status
- Due date visibility and deadline awareness
- Context-based organization display

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation would enable:

1. **Advancing Pattern Creation**: Users consistently experience forward momentum toward their desired outcomes
2. **Context Mastery**: Seamless organization across multiple life domains without overwhelm
3. **AI Assistant Enhancement**: Natural integration with conversational AI workflows
4. **Structural Integrity**: Proper tension maintenance preventing oscillating patterns
5. **Creative Consciousness**: Preserved focus on creation rather than problem-solving

The system should feel like a natural extension of the user's creative thinking process, amplified by AI assistance and organized through proven structural dynamics principles.
