# Unified Implementation Roadmap: COAIA Spiral Agent System → Anthropic Partnership

**Created:** 2025-11-14
**Timeline:** Nov 14, 2025 → Mar 15, 2026 (4 months)
**Integration:** Strategic (Perplexity) + Technical (Claude) + Operational execution
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for execution across all workstreams

---

## Executive Summary

This roadmap unifies three planning streams:

1. **Strategic Planning (Perplexity Agent):**
   - 5-tier revenue model ($1.15M-$2.9M Year 1)
   - Chimera team structure (6 roles)
   - Nov 20 → Jan 15 → Mar 15 milestone framework

2. **Technical Architecture (Claude Agent):**
   - Modular agent system (Ripple, Mia, Miette, Atlas)
   - 7-week refactoring plan
   - Agent bundling strategy

3. **Operational Execution (This Document):**
   - Day-by-day workstreams
   - Team coordination protocols
   - Go/No-Go decision criteria
   - Risk mitigation and pivot points

**Core Thesis:** The modular agent architecture enables all 5 revenue tiers, and the Chimera team model provides the organizational structure to build it.

## Risk Management & Pivot Points

### Risk 1: Pilot Customer Commitment Delays

**Indicators:**
- Dec 15: No pilot customer committed
- Jan 15: Pilot customer not ready to deploy

**Mitigation:**
- Parallel pursuit of multiple prospects (3+)
- Flexible engagement models (pilot can be smaller scope)
- Internal pilot option: Use Chimera team as pilot customer

**Pivot:**
- If no external pilot by Jan 15: Deploy internally
- Document Chimera team using Ceremony Spiral
- Adjust Anthropic proposal to show "internal validation + external interest"

### Risk 2: Technical Complexity Exceeds Timeline

**Indicators:**
- Weeks 2-3: Type extraction or manager refactor taking too long
- Weeks 5-7: Agent implementations blocked

**Mitigation:**
- Strict scope management: MVP agents first, advanced features later
- Pair programming on complex tasks
- Technical advisor (if needed) for specific challenges

**Pivot:**
- Extend Phase 1 by 1-2 weeks if needed
- Adjust Anthropic timeline to Feb 1 instead of Jan 15
- Focus on fewer agents (Ripple + Mia only) for initial release

### Risk 3: Team Capacity Issues

**Indicators:**
- Team members overcommitted
- Deliverables consistently late
- Synchronization protocols breaking down

**Mitigation:**
- Regular capacity check-ins (Friday celebrations)
- Flexible task allocation (swap roles if needed)
- Budget adjustment to hire additional support

**Pivot:**
- Scale back scope: Focus on Phase 1 success, extend Phase 2-3
- Bring in contractor support for specific tasks
- Adjust Year 1 revenue targets downward if capacity limited

### Risk 4: Anthropic Partnership Not Materializing

**Indicators:**
- No response to Jan 15 proposal
- Negative response or not aligned with priorities
- Partnership terms not favorable

**Mitigation:**
- Don't depend solely on Anthropic: Pursue revenue tiers independently
- Alternative partnerships: OpenAI, other AI companies, direct to enterprise
- Strong pilot customer success creates leverage

**Pivot:**
- If Anthropic not interested: Pursue Tier 2 (IAIP) and Tier 3 (Ceremony Spiral platform) independently
- Year 2 target adjusts but still viable ($1M-$3M instead of $2M-$5M)
- Build ecosystem without Anthropic, return when leverage stronger
