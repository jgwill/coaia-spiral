# COAIA Spiral - Structural Tension Chart Templates
# Based on Robert Fritz's methodology for creative goal achievement
# These patterns help create properly structured desired outcomes and action steps

## Understanding Structural Tension Charts

### Core Components:
1. **Desired Outcome** - What you want to CREATE (not solve or fix)
2. **Current Reality** - Honest, factual assessment of where you are now  
3. **Action Steps** - Strategic secondary choices that support the primary choice

### Critical Principle: Action Steps ARE Structural Tension Charts
- Each action step becomes the "Desired Outcome" of its own telescoped chart
- Action steps are NOT simple tasks - they are complete structural tension systems
- Hierarchy: Master Chart (Level 0) → Telescoped Charts (Level 1) → Sub-telescoped Charts (Level 2)

## Template Patterns

### Learning/Skill Development Template:
**Desired Outcome**: "Master [specific skill] to [specific application/context]"
**Current Reality**: "Currently at [honest skill level] with [specific experience]"
**Action Steps**: 
- "Complete foundational understanding of [skill area]" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Apply knowledge through [specific project]" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Validate competency with [specific measurement]" (becomes telescoped chart)

### Creative Project Template:
**Desired Outcome**: "Create [specific deliverable] that [specific value/impact]"
**Current Reality**: "Have [current resources/progress] and [current constraints/situation]"
**Action Steps**:
- "Develop clear vision and requirements" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Build working prototype/draft" (becomes telescoped chart)  
- "Refine through feedback and iteration" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Launch and measure impact" (becomes telescoped chart)

### System/Process Development Template:
**Desired Outcome**: "Establish [specific system] that [specific capability]"
**Current Reality**: "Current approach is [honest assessment] with [specific limitations]"
**Action Steps**:
- "Design system architecture and principles" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Implement core functionality" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Test and validate system performance" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Deploy and monitor system effectiveness" (becomes telescoped chart)

### Relationship/Communication Template:
**Desired Outcome**: "Establish [specific relationship dynamic] that [specific benefit]"
**Current Reality**: "Current dynamic is [honest assessment] with [specific patterns]"
**Action Steps**:
- "Create shared understanding of desired outcome" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Implement new communication patterns" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Build trust through consistent actions" (becomes telescoped chart)
- "Maintain and evolve relationship quality" (becomes telescoped chart)

## Key Guidelines for Creative Orientation

### ✅ Use Creative Language:
- "Create", "Build", "Establish", "Achieve", "Develop"
- Focus on what you want to bring into existence

### ❌ Avoid Problem-Solving Language:
- "Fix", "Solve", "Eliminate", "Prevent", "Stop", "Avoid"
- These create oscillating patterns instead of advancing patterns

### Current Reality Must Be Factual:
- Not "Ready to begin" (this is readiness assumption)
- Use "Currently have [specific status]", "Know [specific knowledge]", "Experience level is [honest assessment]"

### Action Steps Are Strategic Secondary Choices:
- Each action step is chosen BECAUSE it advances toward the desired outcome
- Each can be telescoped into its own complete structural tension chart
- They create momentum through the hierarchy of choices
