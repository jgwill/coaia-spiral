# COAIA Memory - Flexible Context-Based Chart Organization
# Use different contexts for different areas of life/work (similar to original AIM approach)
# Examples: charts-work.jsonl, charts-personal.jsonl, charts-health.jsonl, charts-learning.jsonl

## Context Usage Examples:
# Default/Master: charts.jsonl (no context specified) 
# Work context: charts-work.jsonl (context: "work")
# Personal context: charts-personal.jsonl (context: "personal") 
# Health context: charts-health.jsonl (context: "health")
# Learning context: charts-learning.jsonl (context: "learning")
# Side projects: charts-side-projects.jsonl (context: "side-projects")

## Available Tools:
# create_chart_in_context - Create charts in specific contexts
# list_charts_in_context - View charts in specific contexts  
# list_coaia_projects - See all available contexts and chart counts
# initialize_coaia_project - Set up flexible .coaia structure

## Key Benefits vs Original Rigid Structure:
# ✅ Multiple contexts for different life areas (work, personal, health, etc.)
# ✅ Flexible creation - contexts created automatically as needed
# ✅ Mirrors original AIM multi-database approach but for structural tension charts
# ✅ Users can organize charts by any meaningful categorization

## Structural Tension Methodology (Robert Fritz):
# Focus on what you want to CREATE (not solve or fix)
# Action steps ARE structural tension charts (can be telescoped) 
# Current reality must be factual, not "ready to begin"
# Desired outcomes should use creative language, not problem-solving language

## Context Naming Suggestions:
# Work: "work", "career", "business", "projects"
# Personal: "personal", "family", "relationships", "home"
# Health: "health", "fitness", "wellness", "medical"
# Learning: "learning", "skills", "education", "training" 
# Creative: "creative", "art", "music", "writing"
# Financial: "financial", "investment", "budget", "wealth"
